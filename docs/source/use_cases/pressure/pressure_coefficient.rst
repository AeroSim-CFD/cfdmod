Pressure Coefficient
********************

The pressure coefficient is an adimensionalized form of the pressure signal.
It is obtained by the following expression:

.. math::
   c_{p}(t) = \frac{p(t) - p_{\infty}(t)}{q}

# TODO: Include images of a domain static pressure signal that is relevant and one that is not.
