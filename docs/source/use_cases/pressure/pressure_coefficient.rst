Pressure Coefficient
********************

The pressure coefficient is an **adimensionalized form of the pressure signal**.
It is obtained by the following expression:

.. math::
   c_{p}(t) = \frac{p(t) - p_{\infty}(t)}{q}

By definition, the pressure coefficient is a local property for each point of the mesh.
It is use primarily for analysis and interpretation of the wind tunnel data.

It should always be generated, since it is the first analysis step. 
It is a fundamental property of the pressure normalization.
However, it is not the final result to be delivered to clients.
