Force Coefficient
*****************

This coefficient is defined as a liquid resulting pressure coefficient between two surfaces.

.. math::
   C_{f} = \frac{p_{res1} A_{res1} - p_{res2} A_{res2}}{q A_{rep}}

Like the other coefficients, we can apply statistical analysis to the liquid force coefficient.
