Length Scale
************

The length scale parameter is a fundamental aspect of inflow analysis, delineating the **characteristic size of turbulent structures** present in the atmospheric boundary layer.
Capturing the appropriate length scale in inflow conditions is crucial for resolving turbulent eddies and ensuring that the simulated flow field replicates the complex features of ABL dynamics.
Analyis of length scales validates the selection of **appropriate grid resolutions**, ultimately influencing the accuracy and reliability of CFD simulations.

Autocorrelation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Autocorrelation analysis is essential for unraveling the **temporal coherence of turbulent fluctuations** in the incoming flow.
By quantifying the correlation between velocity values at different time instances, autocorrelation profiles provides insights into the **persistence and periodicity of turbulence structures**.
