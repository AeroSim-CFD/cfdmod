Mean Velocity
*************

Mean velocity profiles represent the averaged profile of flow velocities across the atmospheric boundary layer.
It is extracted from a line probe, or averaged from the temporal evolution of the instantaneous velocity profile.

These profiles are indispensable for **defining the bulk flow characteristics** and serve as a foundation for establishing the inflow boundary conditions in CFD simulations.

It is also used to evaluate the simulated terrain roughness.
According to the Brazilian standard NBR 6123, the **distribution of obstacles** in the terrain **dictate how the atmospheric boundary layer develops**.
For larger obstacles, or rougher terrains, the height of the deformation in the velocity profiles gets bigger.

Accurate representation of mean velocity profiles ensures that the simulated flow field aligns with observed behaviors in the ABL, allowing for a realistic portrayal of wind patterns, boundary layer structure, and other critical aerodynamic features.
