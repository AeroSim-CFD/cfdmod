Turbulence Intensity
********************

Turbulence intensity is a key parameter in inflow analysis for CFD aerodynamic simulations of atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) flow.

It is a crucial metric for assessing the **dynamic nature** of the ABL.
It characterizes the degree of turbulence within the incoming wind, providing insights into the **fluctuations of velocity components**.

Defined as:

.. math::
    I_{xz}(z) = \frac{V_{rms}(z)}{V_{mean}(z)}

Or the ratio of the root mean square of the turbulent component to the mean velocity.
Accurate representation of turbulence intensity in the inflow conditions is vital for capturing the inherent **variability** and **turbulence-driven phenomena** in the simulated flow field.
